Whole dN/dS values for dnds.py is comparable to MATLAB's dnds():

benchmarked using AGAP010815_RA and AAEL001802_RA (after aligning/trimming)

MATLAB whole dnds vs. andy-wenping whole dnds (msCorrect='approximate'): dN/dS: 

1.0958 vs. 1.04939841193 (Elapsed time: 1.952491045, Total warnings: 0), respectively

MATLAB mean(sliding dnds) vs. andy-wenping mean(sliding dnds): Mean dN/dS over all 50-codon long windows: 
1.7254581782566112 (smoothing?) vs. 1.49715496621 (incl. smoothing, stepLength=1) (Elapsed time: 2.29854488373, Total warnings: 173) (when taking the mean of all 50 window intervals in MATLAB's sliding dnds()

Sliding window dN/dS values are also comparable but less so than whole dN/dS, likely due to the gaussian smoothing heuristic we use:
