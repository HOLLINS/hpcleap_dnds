Web service to reveal selective pressures along a user-specified protein sequence, as well as annotate onto that sequence available protein domains information. An example use case is to explore the hypothesis that a given functional region of a given protein is or has been experiencing strong evolutionary selective pressure. For instance, if multiple functional domains present on an Anopheles gambiae protein, X, yet the protein sequences of the functional domains are shown to be experiencing neutral selection, then perhaps the protein is the product of a pseudogene. 
Current problem:
We found that the length of the dNdS indexes is longer than either the query or reference sequences. Why? @Andy, would you check this problem please?
